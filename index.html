    <p>My passion encompasses 3 circles: Business, Technology, and Social Impact.</p>

    <p>Throughout my career, I focused on developing business strategy, bringing ideas to launch, and leveraging business as a powerful force to affect change. 
    I started my career working at a market leader in construction materials. With my passion for creating solutions through a customer centric approach, I led a cross-functional team to launch a new product that improves productivity in Thailand construction. After that, I wanted to explore different industries. Therefore, I transitioned to management consulting at Deloitte, where I leveraged digital to transform business models for market leaders in various industries including consumer business, banking, and heavy industry.
    </p>

    <p> I enjoy solving complex and meaningful challenges. So, I wanted to solve big problems that I experienced in Thailand's education system. As a result, I co-founded a social enterprise which aims to create meaningful education to underprivileged kids through innovative approaches.  
    Ultimately, I want to combine these experiences to empower a cross-functional team to create impact through technology and innovation.
