  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <div class="flex-item-2-col"><img src="images/page3_LB.png" alt = "LB2"></div>
  <p class="flex-item-2-col">Little Builders is a community of passionate people who care about meaningful education and inequality problems. We want to create an effective learning experience for students and create an environment for them to innovate and build solutions that solve community problems around them.
  </p>
  <h3>Challenge</h3>
  <p>I discovered Thai students spend 33% more time studying than students in developed countries. However, standardized PISA tests show we actually have lower performance. I myself have been through this education system for most of my life and realized that this needed to be changed.
  </p>
  <h3>Approach</h3>
  <p>Our approach is the integration of Design Thinking. Instead of telling students what to think, I teach them how to think, by providing hands-on experiences to create community-impact solutions because I believe the best way to learn is by doing.
  We create our own method by adapting Design Thinking to suit Thai students learning context.

  </div>
  <p class="flex-item-2-col">We designed ‘Leadership in Innovation’ course for Naraesuan University. This is the pioneered entrepreneurial and innovation initiative at Narasuan University. <br>
    We want students to solve real life problems. After several on field research in Phitsanulok Province, we found Somsa, a community business in the area that produces Spa products and cosmetics products from local plants. The business struggled to grow because of some limitations. So, our key question for students was ‘How might we improve Somsa business by increasing revenue for their new spa business, and increase people awareness of Somsa communtity. After our process, students came up with many initiatives such as new online platform for spa delivery- at home service, and experience design for community tourism at Somsa.
